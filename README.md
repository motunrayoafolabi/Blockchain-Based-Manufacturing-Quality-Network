# Blockchain-Based Manufacturing Quality Network

A decentralized network for managing manufacturing quality processes, built on blockchain technology using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for manufacturing quality management. It provides a transparent, immutable, and trustworthy system for manufacturers to verify facilities, register quality standards, manage testing protocols, track defects, and share best practices across the network.

The system is built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, offering a secure and decentralized approach to quality management in manufacturing.

## Key Features

- **Facility Verification**: Register and verify manufacturing facilities
- **Standard Registration**: Record and track quality requirements
- **Testing Protocol Management**: Define and execute verification procedures
- **Defect Tracking**: Report and manage quality issues
- **Best Practice Sharing**: Submit and endorse improvement techniques

## Smart Contracts

### Facility Verification Contract
Validates production sites in the manufacturing network.

- Register new manufacturing facilities
- Verify facilities by authorized administrators
- Suspend non-compliant facilities
- Transfer administrative rights

### Standard Registration Contract
Records quality requirements for manufacturing processes.

- Register quality standards with detailed information
- Track compliance status of facilities against standards
- Update compliance status as facilities implement standards

### Testing Protocol Contract
Manages verification procedures for quality standards.

- Register testing protocols linked to quality standards
- Record test results with pass/fail status
- Include detailed notes on test execution

### Defect Tracking Contract
Records identified quality issues.

- Report defects with severity levels
- Track defect status (open, in-progress, resolved, closed)
- Document resolution process and outcomes

### Best Practice Contract
Shares improvement techniques across the manufacturing network.

- Submit best practices with detailed descriptions
- Endorse valuable practices by network participants
- Track implementation of practices by facilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) - Clarity development environment
- [Stacks CLI](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js) - For interacting with the Stacks blockchain
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - For running tests

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-manufacturing-quality.git
   cd blockchain-manufacturing-quality

```markdown project="Blockchain Manufacturing Quality Network" file="README.md"
...
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
```


3. Deploy contracts to a local Clarinet environment:

```shellscript
clarinet console
```




### Testing

Run the test suite using Vitest:

```shellscript
npm test
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Facility

```plaintext
(contract-call? .facility-verification register-facility 
  "facility-001" 
  "Manufacturing Plant Alpha" 
  "New York, USA"
)
```

### Registering a Quality Standard

```plaintext
(contract-call? .standard-registration register-standard
  "standard-001"
  "ISO 9001:2015"
  "Quality management systems requirements"
  "2015"
  "Manufacturing"
)
```

### Recording Test Results

```plaintext
(contract-call? .testing-protocol record-test-result
  "facility-001"
  "protocol-001"
  "test-001"
  u1
  "All requirements met successfully"
)
```

### Reporting a Defect

```plaintext
(contract-call? .defect-tracking report-defect
  "defect-001"
  "facility-001"
  "product-001"
  "Surface finish inconsistency on machined parts"
  u3
)
```

### Submitting a Best Practice

```plaintext
(contract-call? .best-practice submit-best-practice
  "practice-001"
  "Statistical Process Control Implementation"
  "Implementing SPC for critical manufacturing processes reduces defects by monitoring process variations in real-time."
  "Manufacturing"
  "Quality Control"
)
```

## System Architecture

The contracts are designed to work together as an integrated system:

1. Facilities are registered and verified through the Facility Verification Contract
2. Quality standards are registered in the Standard Registration Contract
3. Testing protocols are linked to standards in the Testing Protocol Contract
4. Defects are reported and tracked in the Defect Tracking Contract
5. Best practices are shared through the Best Practice Contract


All contracts include proper authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper access controls
- Critical operations require administrative privileges
- Data validation is performed for all inputs
- Contracts follow Clarity best practices for security


## Future Enhancements

- Integration with IoT devices for automated quality testing
- Machine learning analysis of defect patterns
- Supply chain integration for end-to-end quality tracking
- Mobile application for field inspections and reporting
